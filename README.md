## Story
### Pre-Tux
Before Tux was even born, the grassland was another forest. This forest had very large Granitos with no moss on their heads. These Granitos existed until they used every resource, like the wood from the trees, for their houses, the Red Castle, and what would eventually become the Old Ruins. Then, they started to fight each other (these Granitos were NOT peaceful) until there were just a few left hiding in what became of the building that is now the Old Ruins. There was a prophecy written that there would be a penguin chasing another creature through the grassland, eventually resulting in the destruction of the Red Castle, which means there would be nothing left except the Old Ruins. They didn't predict the new granitos from the Rooted Forest finding the grassland, although they knew somehow that they would be replaced.

Also, nobody died in the fight, all that happened was most of the old granitos finding hidden islands and living the rest of their 100000s of years there.

### Tux Arrives At The Grassland
When Tux arrives at the grassland, he finds that Nolok has already put the forest enemies there, although there are some new ones. Tux decides he wouldn't give up, and runs towards the Red Castle that he can see in the distance.

### Burning Grassland
Tux eventually makes it three quarters of the way through, when he decides to sleep. When he wakes up, the entire grassland is on fire and the only way to stop it is the Red Castle being destroyed, so Tux runs towards the Red Castle and destroys it by pressing a button. To be clear, he had no idea that he'd need to press a button, or go to the Red Castle, in fact he had no clue that was how to stop the fire. He didn't think it could be stopped. But once the castle is destroyed, the fire magically disappears, and Tux sees that Nolok isn't there, and to stop being angry at the fact that Nolok keeps leaving the islands, he goes to the Old Ruins to calm down.
